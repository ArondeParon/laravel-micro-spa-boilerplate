# Forms & Data Manipulation

> https://github.com/bayareawebpro/searchable-resource

This package is designed to make building searchable, sortable & filterable resource indexes by extracting resusable queries and using a method chained builder class for composition.  Requests are validated and responses are JsonResource classes. Frontend JS Controllers & Vue.js components are provided that interface with these responses.
