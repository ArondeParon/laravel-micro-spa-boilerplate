# Advanced - Dark UI 

> An "advanced" Laravel SPA Boilerplate featuring a dark themed UI.

This boilerplate is an on-going work in progress to build 
out a solid starter project that can quickly scaffold UIs and doesn't depend on any specific 
Vue.js Framework.  It's 100% custom written.

- It uses Laravel Sanctum Authentication and the methodology is API-Driven Development.  All SPA routes are accessible via the API.
- It depends on two packages I wrote: One for the Back-end Resource Indexes, and the other for Front-end Dependency Injection.
- If you're not intermediate to advanced with ES6 / Vue & Laravel, you might struggle to understand it the how to use it. 
- Feel free to join the discord server and make any recommendations or suggestions, contributions welcome.
