# Advanced - Dark UI 

> An "advanced" Laravel SPA Boilerplate featuring a dark themed UI.

This project is an on-going work in progress to build out a solid starter project that can quickly scaffold UIs 
and doesn't depend on any specific Vue.js Framework. It's 100% custom written to retain control over the implementation.

- It uses Laravel Sanctum Authentication and the methodology is API-Driven Development.
- It depends on two packages I wrote: One for the Back-end Searchable Resources, and the other for Front-end Dependency Injection, and AutoLoading of Javascript.  
- Feel free to join the discord server and make any recommendations or suggestions, contributions welcome.
